## Configuration
`useArtistsTag` can be set to `true` or `false` to enable/disable `artists` and `albumartists` tag

`trackCoverSize` can be set to `original` for very high quality cover art, however this breaks FFmpeg embedding if it's over 16MB

`metadataEmbedder` can be set to `ffmpeg` or `kid3` to change how metadata is embedded, `kid3` must be downloaded for it to work

`allowUserUploads` can be set to allow/block user uploaded tracks

`tagSeperator` the seperator used when adding multiple values to the same metadata tag (eg. artists)

`coverFilename` can be set to null to delete jpg after embedding

`segmentWaitMin` and `segmentWaitMax` adds a delay between downloading segments, can maybe reduce ban or rate limit risk (if there is one)

Check out `config.json` for more

## Dependencies
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - JavaScript runtime
* [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - Used to extract FLAC/M4A from MP4 container and embed metadata
* [Kid3-cli](https://kid3.kde.org) - Alternative option for embedding metadata

## Warning
There may be a risk of getting banned for using a tool like this, however i've yet to see that happen

## How TIDAL authenticates a browser
* Browser sends request to `https://login.tidal.com/api/email/user/existing` containing a client ID, code challenge, redirect URI, scope, login credentials and more
* Browser sends request to `https://login.tidal.com/success` which redirects to `https://tidal.com/login/auth`, containing the code
* Browser requests token using the `authorization_code` grant type

## How TIDAL authenticates a Android TV (a "Limited Input Device")
* App sends request to `https://auth.tidal.com/v1/oauth2/device_authorization` containing client ID and scope. Response contains a device code, user code, how long the user code is valid for and a interval for requesting the token
* App periodically requests a token using the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` grant type to verify sign in, request contains client ID, client secret, the device code from earlier and more
